# Hoax-Detector

Authenticity of news has now become a major problem. The Idea is to classify the News into Real/Fake using Features from the Text Content of the article. Title and Text of the article are taken as input and Feature Engineering is performed by using Regular Expression . Our solution provides a system to detect fake news based on certain linguistic characteristics.
   
## Extracted Features :

• _**Punctuations Count**_  – Question mark (?), Exclamation mark (!), Comma (,) , Dot (.) . <br>
